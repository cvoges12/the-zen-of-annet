The Zen of Annet
================
**The way of thinking about the Annet ecosystem**

General Zen
-----------
1. Purity is better than pragmatism. 
  - Pragmatism is not to be ignored.
2. Simple is better than complex.
  - Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard.
3. Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Implicit is allowed where explicit context is provided.
4. Error is to be found ahead of time.
  - Error is never to be silenced.
5. Safety should never be optional.
  - Security should be a default.
6. Certainty is better than probability.
  - Probability is better than possibility.
7. Automation should be made for non-one-offs.
  - Templates are not tools for automation.
8. State of change should be controlled.
  - Change is necessary but to be tracked.
9. Relational is better than Reactive.
  - Flexibility should be explicitly defined.
10. Abstraction is better than control.
  - Some actions should remain forbidden.

Specific Zen
------------
1. Mathematics is greater than experience.
2. Type Driven Development is greater than Test Driven Development.
3. Everything is an object whether explicitly defined or not.
4. Hierarchal object abuse is not a virtue.
